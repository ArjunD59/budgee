# budgee

A web page that analyzes recent spending behavior (via banking dashboards or uploads), then uses machine learning or rules-based forecasting to predict whether you'll overspend by the end of the month — and warns you early.

Key Features:
Spending Trend Tracker
 - Tracks spending by category (groceries, dining, subscriptions, etc.)
 - Visualizes daily/weekly spending patterns
Forecast Engine
 - Uses a rolling average, linear regression, or lightweight ML model to forecast monthly total
 - Includes seasonal and weekday/weekend spending adjustments
Early-Warning Alerts
 - Pops up visual alerts when you're trending over budget
 - Encourages corrective action (“Pause on Uber Eats this week?”)
